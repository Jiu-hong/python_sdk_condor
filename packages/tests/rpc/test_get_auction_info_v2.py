"""
Tests for GetAuctionInfoV2 RPC functionality.

This module contains test cases for the GetAuctionInfoV2 RPC call, which retrieves
auction information from a Casper node for a specific block. The tests verify:
- Auction information retrieval for specific block
- Error handling for invalid block ID
- Response parsing and validation
- Connection handling
- Auction state validation
